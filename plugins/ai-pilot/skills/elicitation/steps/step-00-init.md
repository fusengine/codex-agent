# Step 0: Initialize Elicitation

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 🔴 NEVER skip this step
- ✅ ALWAYS detect execution mode first
- ✅ ALWAYS load expert context from Execute phase
- 🔍 FOCUS on understanding what was coded

---

## Context Boundaries

**Input from Execute phase:**
- Files created/modified
- Code type (auth, API, UI, etc.)
- Framework used
- Expert agent that coded

**Output for next steps:**
- `{elicit_mode}`: manual | auto | skip
- `{code_files}`: list of modified files
- `{code_type}`: detected code category
- `{expert_agent}`: which expert coded

---

## YOUR TASK:

### 1. Detect Execution Mode

```
Check arguments:
- --auto   → {elicit_mode} = "auto"
- --manual → {elicit_mode} = "manual"
- --skip   → {elicit_mode} = "skip"
- (none)   → {elicit_mode} = "manual" (default)
```

### 2. Load Execute Context

```
Gather from previous phase:
- Which files were created/modified
- What type of code was written
- Which expert agent performed the work
- What framework/language was used
```

### 3. Validate Context

```
Required for next steps:
✓ At least 1 file modified
✓ Code type identifiable
✓ Expert agent known
```

### 4. Handle Skip Mode

```
IF {elicit_mode} == "skip":
  → Output: "Elicitation skipped. Proceeding to sniper validation."
  → END (do not continue to step 1)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## 🟣 Elicitation Initialized

**Mode**: {elicit_mode}
**Expert**: {expert_agent}
**Code Type**: {code_type}
**Files to Review**:
- {file_1}
- {file_2}

→ Proceeding to Step 1: Analyze Code
```
