## Phase 5: DESIGN AUDIT — Validate quality and accessibility

### When
After Phase 4 animations are applied. Final quality validation.

### Input (from Phase 4)
- Complete components with animations, interactive states, and visual effects.
- `design-system.md` as the audit baseline.

### Steps
1. **Load baseline** — Read `design-system.md` to establish expected tokens, fonts, colors.
2. **Run audit checklist** from `references/audit-checklist.md`:
   - Typography: fonts match design-system, no forbidden fonts, fluid scale works.
   - Colors: all OKLCH, no hard-coded hex/RGB, semantic tokens used.
   - Spacing: consistent base unit, no magic numbers.
   - Motion: timing within limits, reduced-motion supported.
3. **Check consistency** per `references/consistency-checks.md` — cross-component visual coherence (border-radius, shadows, spacing rhythm).
4. **Run anti-AI-slop audit** from `references/anti-ai-slop-audit.md` — detect generic purple gradients, Inter font, flat backgrounds, missing animations.
5. **Validate WCAG** per `references/ux-wcag.md` — contrast 4.5:1 text / 3:1 UI, focus indicators, touch targets 44x44px minimum.
6. **Apply UX heuristics** — Nielsen (`references/ux-nielsen.md`), UX laws (`references/ux-laws.md`), patterns (`references/ux-patterns.md`).
7. **Generate audit report** — categorized findings (Critical / Major / Minor) with fix recommendations.
8. **Apply fixes** — Correct all Critical and Major issues before proceeding.

### Output
- Audit report with categorized findings and applied fixes.
- All Critical/Major issues resolved. WCAG AA compliant. Anti-AI-slop passed.

### Next → Phase 6: FINAL REVIEW
`6-handoff-review/SKILL.md` — Screenshot light+dark, compare 3 elements, fix gaps, report.
